How they're created
Machine learning models, especially generative AI models, create embeddings by identifying patterns in large datasets. 
Where they're used
Embeddings are used in applications across Google Cloud, including BigQuery, Cloud Database, Vertex AI Search, and Workspace. 

You can use Vertex AI to create and use embeddings. Vertex AI offers a variety of embedding models, including text embedding models, fine-tuned text embedding models, and open-source embedding models.
