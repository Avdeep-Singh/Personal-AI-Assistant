In Google Cloud, embeddings are numerical representations of text, images, or videos that help machine learning models understand relationships in data: 

How they work
Embeddings are created by converting text, images, or videos into arrays of floating point numbers, called vectors. The distance between the vectors represents the similarity between the objects. 

How they're used
Machine learning models use embeddings to perform tasks like semantic search, classification, and recommendation. For example, Google uses embeddings to power applications like Google Search and music streaming recommendations.
